# DataSpaces RESTPLUS API

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a RESTPLUS API for DataSpaces using FastAPI.

## What is DataSpaces?

DataSpaces is a middleware framework that provides a virtual shared space for data exchange between scientific applications. It supports high-speed communication and efficient data handling, enabling applications to share data in real-time without significant overhead.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the code necessary to set up and run a RESTPLUS API for interacting with DataSpaces. The API provides endpoints for data and metadata management, allowing users to perform CRUD operations and real-time data processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- DataSpaces backend system

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the environment and installing dependencies will be provided soon.

## Usage

Guidelines for running the FastAPI application and accessing the API endpoints will be added.
